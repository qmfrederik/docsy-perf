title: IHouseArrestApi.house_arrest_send_command method
---

Send a command to the connected house_arrest service. Calls house_arrest_send_request() internally.

```csharp
public HouseArrestError house_arrest_send_command(HouseArrestClientHandle client, string command, 
    string appid)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| client | The house_arrest client to use. |
| command | The command to send. Currently, only VendContainer and VendDocuments are known. |
| appid | The application identifier to pass along with the . |

## Return Value

HOUSE_ARREST_E_SUCCESS if the command was successfully sent, HOUSE_ARREST_E_INVALID_ARG if client, command, or appid is invalid, HOUSE_ARREST_E_INVALID_MODE if the client is not in the correct mode, or HOUSE_ARREST_E_CONN_FAILED if a connection error occurred.

## Remarks

If this function returns HOUSE_ARREST_E_SUCCESS it does not mean that the command was successful. To check for success or failure you need to call house_arrest_get_result().

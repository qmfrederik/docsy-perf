title: PlistNativeMethods.plist_is_binary method
---

Test if in-memory plist data is binary or XML This method will look at the first bytes of plist_data to determine if plist_data contains a binary or XML plist. This method is not validating the whole memory buffer to check if the content is truly a plist, it's only using some heuristic on the first few bytes of plist_data.

```csharp
public static int plist_is_binary(string plistData, uint length)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| plist_data | a pointer to the memory buffer containing plist data. |
| length | length of the buffer to read. |

## Return Value

1 if the buffer is a binary plist, 0 otherwise.

title: MobileBackupNativeMethods.mobilebackup_receive_restore_file_received method
---

Receive a confirmation from the device that it successfully received a restore file.

```csharp
public static MobileBackupError mobilebackup_receive_restore_file_received(
    MobileBackupClientHandle client, out PlistHandle result)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| client | The connected MobileBackup client to use. |
| result | Pointer to a plist_t that will be set to the received plist for further processing. The caller has to free it using plist_free(). Note that it will be set to NULL if the operation itself fails due to a communication or plist error. If this parameter is NULL, it will be ignored. |

## Return Value

MOBILEBACKUP_E_SUCCESS on success, MOBILEBACKUP_E_INVALID_ARG if client is invalid, MOBILEBACKUP_E_REPLY_NOT_OK if the expected 'BackupMessageRestoreFileReceived' message could not be received, MOBILEBACKUP_E_PLIST_ERROR if the received message is not a valid backup message plist, or MOBILEBACKUP_E_MUX_ERROR if a communication error occurs.

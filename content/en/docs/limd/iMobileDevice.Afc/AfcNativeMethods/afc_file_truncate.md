title: AfcNativeMethods.afc_file_truncate method
---

Sets the size of a file on the device.

```csharp
public static AfcError afc_file_truncate(AfcClientHandle client, ulong handle, ulong newsize)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| client | The client to use to set the file size. |
| handle | File handle of a previously opened file. |
| newsize | The size to set the file to. |

## Return Value

AFC_E_SUCCESS on success or an AFC_E_* error value.

## Remarks

This function is more akin to ftruncate than truncate, and truncate calls would have to open the file before calling this, sadly.

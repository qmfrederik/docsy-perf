title: MobileBackup2Api.mobilebackup2_receive_raw method
---

Receive binary from the device.

```csharp
public virtual MobileBackup2Error mobilebackup2_receive_raw(MobileBackup2ClientHandle client, 
    byte[] data, uint length, ref uint bytes)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| client | The MobileBackup client to receive from. |
| data | Pointer to a buffer that will be filled with the received data. |
| length | Number of bytes to receive. The data buffer needs to be large enough to store this amount of data. |
| bytes | Number of bytes actually received. |

## Return Value

MOBILEBACKUP2_E_SUCCESS if any or no data was received, MOBILEBACKUP2_E_INVALID_ARG if one of the parameters is invalid, or MOBILEBACKUP2_E_MUX_ERROR if receiving the data failed.

## Remarks

This function returns MOBILEBACKUP2_E_SUCCESS even if no data has been received (unless a communication error occurred). The fourth parameter is required and must be checked to know how many bytes were actually received.

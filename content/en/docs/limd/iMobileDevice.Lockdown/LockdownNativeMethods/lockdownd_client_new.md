title: LockdownNativeMethods.lockdownd_client_new method
---

Creates a new lockdownd client for the device.

```csharp
public static LockdownError lockdownd_client_new(iDeviceHandle device, 
    out LockdownClientHandle client, string label)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| device | The device to create a lockdownd client for |
| client | The pointer to the location of the new lockdownd_client |
| label | The label to use for communication. Usually the program name. |

## Return Value

LOCKDOWN_E_SUCCESS on success, LOCKDOWN_E_INVALID_ARG when client is NULL

## Remarks

This function does not pair with the device or start a session. This has to be done manually by the caller after the client is created. The device disconnects automatically if the lockdown connection idles for more than 10 seconds. Make sure to call lockdownd_client_free() as soon as the connection is no longer needed.

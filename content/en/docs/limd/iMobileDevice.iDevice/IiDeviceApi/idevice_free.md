title: IiDeviceApi.idevice_free method
---

Cleans up an idevice structure, then frees the structure itself. This is a library-level function; deals directly with the device to tear down relations, but otherwise is mostly internal.

```csharp
public iDeviceError idevice_free(IntPtr device)
```

| parameter | description |
